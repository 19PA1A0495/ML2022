# ML2022

The main idea of this project is to analyse the different parameters of a person like age, cholestrol, BP levels and find appropriate drug for their condition. For this I created a classification model that trains the data and then will be tested. The output of this project is to find the appropriate model for classification.

There are 200 rows and 6 labels that include:  
1. Age
2. Sex
3. Cholestrol
4. BP
5. Na_to_k (sodium and potassium levels)
6. Drug

I've created three classification models:
1. KNN Classifier
2. Random forest classifier
3. SVM classifier
